### Step 1: Enable Apps

Go to the [**Apps**](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) page in the Cobalt dashboard.
You'll see a list of the available apps. Choose a couple of apps to enable. The
apps you enable become available to your end users.

By default, all connectors use sandbox OAuth apps from Cobalt. This makes it
easy for you to get started and connect integrations right away.

Once you're ready to ship your integrations with Cobalt, you should use your own
OAuth apps. Cobalt supports bringing your own OAuth clients for supported
services by configuring them in our dashboard. This will make sure users see
**your brand** instead of Cobalt when they connect integrations.

### Step 2: Create a Workflow

You can build workflows that connect data between your application and your
users' apps. Cobalt's visual workflow builder allows you to create custom
integrations that your users can activate in their integrations.

Cobalt Workflows provide a visual abstraction layer on top of third-party APIs,
making it easy to build integrations without specific knowledge of each API
provider. Workflows consist of a **trigger**, which determines how a workflow is
initiated, and **steps**, which represent an action that's performed as part of
the workflow.

Here are some common step types that can get you started building workflows:

- **Triggers** - used to trigger a specific workflow
- **Integration actions** - perform an action in your users' connected app
  account, like sending a Slack message or querying contacts from Salesforce
- **Requests** - make a request to any API, such as posting data to your
  application server
- **Conditionals** - add conditional branching logic to your workflows

#### When to use Workflows

Workflows are often best suited for common use cases including:

- Pushing data from your application to your users' apps
- Receiving new or updated data from your users' apps (Webhooks)
- Allowing your users to configure integration options with custom fields
- Enabling non-engineering teams (e.g. Product or Client Services teams) to
  configure integrations without writing code

Here are some common examples of specific Workflows for a few integrations:

- **Slack** -Send notifications from your application to Slack
- **Salesforce** - Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce
- **HubSpot** - Sync contacts HubSpot to your application
- **Google Calendar** - Create Google Calendar events from events in your
  application
