title: "Setup App Events"
description:
  "App Events are custom events that are sent programmatically from your
  application via the API to trigger Workflows."
---

For example, you might send a "Contact Created" App Event from your application
to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users' Salesforce
CRM.

**Create an event**

To create an event, go to the [Your App](https://app.gocobalt.io/your-app) page
in Cobalt dashboard. Under the event tab click on add new event. Next, enter the
name and event schema of your Event. The **event schema** that you enter here
should be an example payload sent from your application to Cobalt.

<Note>
  The **event schema** must be a valid JSON object, and can contain any
  arbitrary JSON.

App Events can be sent from your application using the REST API to the below
endpoint unique to your application.

You must pass two parameters:

- **name** - the event name defined in your App Event

- **payload** - the event payload that should match the event schema defined in
  your App Event

See the code examples below for how to send App Events using the Cobalt SDK or
API.

```json REST API
// Trigger the "Contact Created" App Event
POST https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/webhook/

// Headers
x-api-key:
Content-Type: application/json
linked_account_id:
config_id (optional):

{
    "linked_account_id": ,
    "trigger_name": "Contact Created",
    "payload": {
        "name": "Abhishek",
        "email": "abhishek@gocobalt.io"
    }
}
```

You can copy your exact payload once you save the event on the cobalt dashboard.
When sending live events from your application, Cobalt will not validate that
your event payload matches the defined event schema.
