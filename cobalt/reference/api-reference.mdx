Welcome to the Cobalt API reference documentation!

You can use this API to integrate with Cobalt and `fetch` integrations that your users have authorized.

### Base API URL

All API endpoints in the reference documentation below are relative to the following base URL:

```
https://api.gocobalt.io/
```

### Cobalt SDK

If you'd like to use a Cobalt SDK to integrate with Cobalt instead of forming your own API requests, you can find the installation and usage instructions for all of our available SDK's [here](/cobalt/sdks/backend-sdks).

We highly recommend using our SDKs as they are more frequently updated and provide faster development.
