Linked accounts need to have a **unique ID**. You can freely choose a consumer
ID yourself. Most of the time, this is an ID of your internal data model that
represents a user or account in your system (for example `account:12345`). If
the consumer doesn't exist yet, we will upsert a consumer based on your ID.
