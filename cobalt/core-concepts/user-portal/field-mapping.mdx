A **Field Mapping** is a type of User Setting that allows your users to define a mapping between an object in your application (an "Application Object") and an object in their connected integration account (an "Integration Object").


### Adding to the User Portal

Field Mapping settings can be added by visiting the "User Portal" screen from a supported integration in your dashboard. 

Add field mapping from the list of data type available for the app.
