**All workflows start with a trigger**, which determines when the workflow will
run and how data is passed into the workflow. Available workflow trigger types
include:

### Custom App Event

App Events are custom events that are sent programmatically from your
application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App
Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application
to your users' apps.

For example, you might send a "Contact Created" App Event from your application
to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users' Salesforce
CRM.

**Once defined, an App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows.** This
is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar
workflows across different integrations. You can build the
[**app event**](/cobalt/getting-started/setup-app-events) in the custom app.

### Default App Triggers

Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users'
apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts
are created in your users' Salesforce account to sync your users' Salesforce
contacts to your application in real-time.

### Scheduler

The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a
**scheduled time or interval**.

- **Seconds** (e.g. every 5 seconds)
- **Minutes** (e.g. every 30 minutes)
- **Hourly** (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour)
- **Daily** (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am)
- **Weekly** (e.g. every Monday at 12:00 pm)

Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for
all users who have activated the workflow.

### Integration Enabled

<Warning>_Coming Soon_</Warning>

Integration Enabled triggers can be used to run workflows when a user initially
activates your integration. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow
that syncs all leads from your customer's CRM to your application once they've
enabled the integration.
