title: "Integration actions"
---

**Integration Actions, or just Actions, are the main building blocks of Cobalt
Workflows.** Workflow builder provides Actions for each integration provider
that allow you to perform operations in your users' apps.

For example, common Actions include:

- Create a Salesforce contact
- Send a Slack message
- Update a Hubspot account
- Create Google Calendar events

Cobalt provides a simple-to-use UI for configuring and mapping data into each
Action - making it easy to use Actions without any prior knowledge of an
integration provider's API.

For a complete list of all Actions supported by each Integration Provider, see
our [Integrations Catalogue](/cobalt/reference/integration-catalogue).
