  "Integration Actions, or just Actions, are the main building blocks of Cobalt
  Workflows."

Workflow builder provides Actions for each integration provider that allow you
to perform operations in your users' apps.

For example, common Actions include:

- Create a Salesforce contact
- Send a Slack message
- Update a Hubspot account
- Create Google Calendar events

Cobalt provides a simple-to-use UI for configuring and mapping data into each
Action - making it easy to use Actions without any prior knowledge of an
integration provider's API.
