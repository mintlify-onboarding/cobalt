Workflow action helps you to create complex workflows. There are 3 type of workflow actions

* ****[**Delay**](/cobalt/core-concepts/workflows/workflow-actions#delay)****

* **Http Request**

* **Loop**(Coming Soon)

### 

### Rule

You can add conditional logic to workflows in Paragon using our Conditional step. Conditionals allow you to define rules to determine which of two paths your workflow should execute.

To add a conditional to your workflow, drag and drop the **rule** node in the workflow canvas and configure the rule in the sidebar.

### Delay

You can add delay to your workflow using our delay node. Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. 

To add a delay to your workflow, drag and drop **delay** in the workflow canvas and configure the delay step in the sidebar.

### Http Request

You can make requests to any HTTP API using Cobalt's Request step. This is useful for connecting workflows to your application's internal API, or with any REST APIs in general.


#### Configuring URL Request

You can enter the request URL in the input under "**Request URL"**. You can also include parameters as part of the URL by typing `{{` to invoke the variable menu.

The **variable menu** allows you to reference data from upstream steps in your request URL. For example, we can pass a `userId` from the Trigger into the request URL, which is represented as: `/users/{{1.event.userId}}`

#### Sending Data in Request

You can easily send JSON in a request by choosing `Raw` in the dropdown to the right of Body. When creating the raw JSON body, you can type in **static values** or **reference variables** from upstream steps by typing `{{` to invoke the variable menu.
