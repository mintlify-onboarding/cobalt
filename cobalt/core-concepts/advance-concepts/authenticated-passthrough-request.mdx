Using cobalt's authenticated passthrough request, you can make requests directly to an application API.

Cobalt makes it easy to make API requests to any of cobalt's supported integrations with the account tokens that you've stored on behalf of your users. These requests are sent directly to the application API and follow each applications specific API formats. This approach is ideal for when you're looking to fetch data that Cobalt may not support.
