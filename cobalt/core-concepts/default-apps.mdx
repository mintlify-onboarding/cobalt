Default Integration apps uses cobalt credential for accessing authentication for the end user. To configure applications click on **Apps** in the sidebar menu and select which app you want to manage. Once you select an application, go to setting. For application using OAuth you will be asked to configure your client ID and secret but for application using key based authentication you have to no further configuration.

### Application using OAuth

You'll first need to register a developer app from a third-party app provider that Cobalt supports. Once you create your developer app, you'll receive app credentials - usually a Client ID and Secret - that you'll enter in your Cobalt dashboard in the next step.

You'll need to specify a redirect URL (sometimes called "callback URL") when configuring your developer app for a third-party provider. Here, you should provide Cobalt's redirect URL:

```
// Redirect Url 
```

You can add an integration using cobalt development keys by leaving the app credentials blank. This should only be used for testing, and you should add your own app credentials for use in production.

You can define which permission scopes will be requested from your users under Integration Settings. You'll usually need to make sure the same scopes are defined when configuring your developer app from the third-party app provider.

### Appication using Key based Auth

Apps which are key based does not require any additional configurion.
