To configure applications click on **Apps** in the sidebar menu and select which
app you want to manage. Once you select an application, go to setting. For
application using OAuth you will be asked to configure your client ID and secret
but for application using key based authentication you have to no further
configuration.

### Application using OAuth

You'll first need to register a developer app from a third-party app provider
that Cobalt supports. Once you create your developer app, you'll receive app
credentials - usually a Client ID and Secret - that you'll enter in your Cobalt
dashboard in the next step.

You'll need to specify a redirect URL (sometimes called "callback URL") when
configuring your developer app for a third-party provider. Here, you should
provide Cobalt's redirect URL:

```
// Redirect Url
```

<Note>
  You can add an integration using cobalt development keys by leaving the app
  credentials blank. This should only be used for testing, and you should add
  your own app credentials for use in production.
</Note>

You can define which permission scopes will be requested from your users under
Integration Settings. You'll usually need to make sure the same scopes are
defined when configuring your developer app from the third-party app provider.

### Appication using Key based Auth

Apps which are key based does not require any additional configurion.
