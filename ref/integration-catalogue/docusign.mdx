### 1\. Create a developer account

URL: [https://account-d.docusign.com](https://account-d.docusign.com)

Depending on the DocuSign APIs you plan to work with, you may need to take additional steps to gain access to your desired functionality.

* For the eSignature REST API, DocuSign Admin API, Click API, Monitor API, Rooms API, and other APIs, you can create a developer account to gain access.

### 2\. Add an app

Next, you add an app to your developer account. On the DocuSign platform, an app is a set of parameters that are used to identify and configure an integration.

* You can add an app manually, setting configuration values and choosing your authentication type in the UI through the Apps and Keys page.

* Click Apps and key under Authentication mentioned in sidebar
