You can find your Google app credentials by visiting your [Google Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?supportedpurview=project). 

You'll need the following information to set up your Google App with Cobalt Connect:

* Client ID

* Client Secret

* Scopes Requested

**Note:** You'll need to create a new project in Google Cloud Console if you don't already have one.

### Add the Redirect URL to your Google app

Cobalt provides a redirect URL to send information to your Google app. To add the redirect URL to your Google app:

1\. Copy the link under "**Redirect URL"** in your integration settings in Cobalt. The Redirect URL is:

```
https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth
```

2\. In your [Google Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?supportedpurview=project), navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials** in the sidebar.

3\. Press "**\+ Create Credentials**", then select **OAuth client ID.**

4\. Select "**Web application**" from the Application type drop-down menu.

**Note:** You'll need to configure Google's [consent screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) for access to **Client ID** and **Client Secret** if you haven't already.

6\. Paste-in the redirect URL from Cobalt.

7\. Press the blue "**Create**" button.

Google provides you with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** needed for the next steps after adding the redirect URL to your project.

### Enable Google Sheets API in Google Cloud Console Dashboard

1\. Select **Google Sheets** from the **Integrations Catalog**.

2\. Under **Integrations > Connected Integrations >** _**{YOUR\_APP}**_ **\>** **Settings**, fill out your credentials from the end of Step 1 in their respective sections:

* **Client ID:** Found at the end of Step 1.

* **Client Secret:** Found at the end of Step 1.

* **Permissions:** Select the scopes you've requested for your application. They should begin with `sheets`.
